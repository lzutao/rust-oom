Took inspirations from [the "Parse, donâ€™t validate" article][pdv].

This package defines three types: `NonEmptySlice`, `NonEmptyMutSlice`
and `NonEmptyVec`. Those types don't implement `Deref` or `DerefMut` trait,
it is intentional to avoid confusion when resolving methods.
If you want `&[T]`, consider using `as_slice` or `as_mut_slice` methods.

`NonEmptySlice` and `NonEmptyMutSlice`:

* are borrow types (not owned type).
* are counterparts of `&[T]` and `&mut [T]`.
* have same size and similar niche as `&[T]`
* cannot be used without borrow contents from array, slice or `Vec`.

`NonEmptyVec`:

* is an owned types, counterparts of `Vec<T>`.
* doesn't have `push` and `pop` methods, because those are fallible operations.
  I had to deal with unsafe codes that I am not confident if I want to implement them.

The differences from `&[T]` and `Vec<T>`:
* `.len()` returns std's `NonZeroUsize`.
* `.is_empty()` is always false.
* These methods don't return `None`:
  - `first`
  - `first_mut`
  - `last`
  - `last_mut`
  - `split_first`
  - `split_last`
  - `split_first_mut`
  - `split_last_mut`

## Notable features

* `#![no_std]`
* no external dependencies
* no macros
* instant build time.

## Supported Rust versions

Latest stable. I use the new conditional flows in `const fn` available only in Rust v1.46.0.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
oom = "0.0.1"
```

Or assuming you installed [`cargo-edit`][edit], use:

```
cargo add oom
```
